### Introduction

In this series of articles, I will present the whole journey of building my own
trading bot. I will start with the basic ideas of how a trading bot should act
and will then go through the process of implementing it.

---
### Motivations

For the past three years, I have been interested in trading cryptocurrencies in
my spare time: sometimes making profits and sometimes being liquidated ðŸ˜“

I also like to automate things with code. For example, I automated the
deployment of the services hosted on my Raspberry Pi and the setup of my MacBook
itself. I prefer to automate processes instead of doing it manually multiple
times.

Moreover, I have been developing programs in many languages and I recently
started to learn [Go](https://go.dev/). Indeed, what a better way to learn a new
programming language than practicing it.

Therefore, it makes sense for me to build a trading bot because it is the
combination of trading, coding and automating!

### What I expect from this project

The goal of the project is not only to have a trading bot at the end, but to
share the story of how I built it and my thoughts at every step of the journey.

I expect to learn a lot on all the technical aspects of the project, as well as
the financial mathematics behind it. For example, microservices, technical
analysis and trading strategies.

Moreover, I am majoring in cybersecurity. I will therefore be taking security
into account during the whole process: it is an important part of every program,
as some parts of the bot will be exposed to the internet.

### How I will proceed

As said above, the goal is to share the journey of the project. I will post
articles about a topic or a part of the trading bot regularly. Do not expect me
to write weekly, as it takes a lot of time to prepare and write a blog post and
to code the bot itself.

However, I will not post an article on all parts of the trading bot and I will
not share the entire source code publicly. The reason is that I do not want to
be responsible for any loss that can occur with the use of it.

### Disclaimer

This series of article is not a tutorial on how to build a trading bot. It is
instead a story on how I built it. I do not claim to be an expert in the field
of trading. I am not a professional trader and I did not follow any trading
course. This series of articles are for inspiration only. Again, it is NOT a
tutorial.
